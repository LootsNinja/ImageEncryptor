# ImageEncryptor
Android app to encrypt and decrypt images

it uses a seed (from 0 - 9999) for unique encryption as well as scattering coefficient to adjust the level of image encryption (1 - 9999).
sending the encrypted image without compression (via emails or bluetooth) will 100% decrypt it,
recompressing the image by sending it throught social media (whatsapp, viber, facebook... etc.)
results in a noisy decryption and loss of colors but the content of the image can still be read.
